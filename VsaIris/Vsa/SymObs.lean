# Observed ALU steps in symbolic runs

The reflected block model (`MKind`, `Vsa/Sim/BlockMem.lean`) has no `sltu`
or `sltiu`, so `snez`/`seqz` have no reflected segment. VSA proves such an
instruction by observation: `stepObs_alu` gives ONE step that advances the PC
by four, writes ONE GPR and leaves memory and every other register alone
(`ReadsLikePost σ' (sigmaPost_alu …)`).

* `aluStep_of_obs`: such an observation, stated at every well-formed state
  whose source registers and code bytes hold, is H3's `Inst.AluStep` for any
  destination register (H3's `snezAluStep` and H5's `aluA0_runFact` are the
  `a0` instances written by hand).
* `swp_alu`: an `AluStep` as one step of a symbolic run (`SWP`), the
  `swp_jal` of an ALU instruction outside the block model.

The step-table generators (`scripts/gen_interp_steps.py`) emit, per `sltu`/
`sltiu` instruction, the observation (`stepObs_alu` + the decode table + the
`execute_*_char` lemma) and an `itO_<pc>` step lemma over these two.
