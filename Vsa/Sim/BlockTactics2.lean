# Stage C — block-frame discharge helpers (`BlockTactics2`)

Reusable helpers for the register-frame side-conditions the block frame lemmas
(`hframePro`/`hframeBlk`/`hframeTail`, i.e. the `∀ R … → σ'.R = σ.R` outputs of
`neg_prologue_block`/`neg_loadstore_full`/`neg_tail_block`) demand at each call
site. Each such application needs two arguments for a universally-quantified
register `R`:

1. `(∀ rr ∈ noiseRegs, (rr == R) = false)` — closed by `abiNoise_noiseRegs hR`.
2. `(∀ n ∈ wrRegsM b.body, (gprReg n == R) = false)` — closed by the
   `block_frame_wr` tactic given the block's concrete written-reg index list.

`abiPreserved_ne` is the standalone form of the local `abi_ne'` those proofs
carried inline (the callee-saved exceptions like `he8 : (Register.x8 == R) =
false` are picked up by an `assumption` arm).

NO `sorry`/`axiom`/`native_decide`/`bv_decide`. Only Lean 4 core + Std tactics.

/-- `AbiPreserved R` and `¬ AbiPreserved X` give `(X == R) = false`: two distinct

/-- `block_frame_wr [i₀, …, iₖ]` closes a goal
`∀ n ∈ wrRegsM b.body, (gprReg n == R) = false` (or the `wrChain` variant) where
`[i₀, …, iₖ]` is the block's concrete list of written GPR indices (as it reduces
under `wrRegsM`/`wrChain`). It reduces the membership to a `k+1`-way disjunction
of `n = iⱼ` equalities, substitutes each, and closes every resulting
`(gprReg iⱼ == R) = false` by `abiPreserved_ne` (an anonymous `AbiPreserved R =
true` reached by `assumption`, `AbiPreserved (gprReg iⱼ) = false` by `decide`)
with an `assumption` fallback that picks up any callee-saved exception hyp in
context (e.g. `he8 : (Register.x8 == R) = false` for the callee-saved `x8`). The
`rcases` alternative count is derived from the list length so the substitutions
actually fire. -/

  -- (`sepBy1(rcasesPat, " | ")`) so the `rcases` substitutions actually fire.
  -- an UNHYGIENIC `rfl` ident: `rcases` recognises the subst pattern by matching
  -- the raw name `` `rfl ``, so macro scopes must not be attached.

/-! ## C3 — load/store side-condition bundle discharge (`ld_ok` / `st_ok`)

The block Pres (`NegBlockProto.LdOK8`/`LdOK4`/`StOK8`) each bundle the RAM-bound /
HTIF-window / alignment sub-facts (and, for loads, the byte pins). Call sites used
to spell out the anonymous constructor with a per-field `by rw [haddr…]; omega`.
These tactics assemble the bundle from ONE address-normaliser `haddr : ea.toNat =
k` (the RAM/window/alignment facts then follow by `omega` off the ambient `sp`/
`tohost` bounds) plus the caller's byte pins.

`tohostAddr` is a `def`; `omega` can't see through it, so each tactic first
rewrites it to its literal value (`rfl`) before the `omega`. -/

/-- Discharge an `StOK8 ea` from `haddr : ea.toNat = k`: RAM bounds + above-HTIF
window + 8-alignment, all by `omega` off the ambient `sp`/tohost bounds. -/
macro "st_ok" haddr:term : tactic =>
  `(tactic|
    refine ⟨?_, ?_, ?_, ?_⟩ <;>

        | (rw [show tohostAddr = (0x8001ad00 : Nat) from rfl, $haddr:term]; omega)
        | (rw [$haddr:term]; omega))

/-- Discharge an `LdOK8 m ea bs` from `haddr : ea.toNat = k` and the eight byte
pins `[p0,…,p7]` (each `m[k+i]? = some bᵢ`). The RAM/window tuple goes
by `omega`; each pin rewrites `ea.toNat` by `haddr` and closes by the supplied
proof. -/
macro "ld_ok8" haddr:term:max " [" ps:term,* "]" : tactic =>
  `(tactic|

/-- `LdOK4` variant of `ld_ok8` — four byte pins.

WAVE 48k: the byte obligations are TOTAL-READ equalities now, so each alternative
tries, in order, `rfl` (the byte IS named as the total read — the case that used
to need the refuted `frame_pop` presence), the supplied fact as-is, and the
supplied PRESENCE fact lifted through `lpin_of_present`. -/
