# `BridgeSeg` — the Shape-A `env_define` bridge, factored over the seg machinery

Every `env_define` Shape-A bridge (`bridgeStrlenPre`/`bridgeMallocPre`/
`bridgeCapCompute`/`bridgeNamesToVals`) is the SAME shape:

```
  <straight-line argument-marshalling body>   -- a #derive_case seg (EnvDefSeg pattern)
  jal <callee>                                -- the Shape-D call seam
  ⟹  Triple (entry)  (calleePre ∧ carried-frame)
```

Before this file, each bridge hand-wrote a `*Prefix_run` lemma
(`capComputePrefix_run` is ~175 lines: 5 per-site `stepObs_*` lemmas ×~30 lines
each + the run threading + a hand per-register frame across all steps) and then a
`*_closed` repackager.

`BridgeSeg` factors the **whole run + jal seam + frame threading** into ONE
theorem `bridgeOfSeg`.  It composes:

* the `#derive_case` seg body run (via `segEval_sound`) — the whole `Steps` chain,
  computed end PC (`= jalPC`, the seg is the body *up to* the jal), computed
  marshalled registers `GHolds σ' out.regs`, and computed memory
  `writeLog m0 out.log`, all FREE (the seg's one kernel `decide` `hwf`);
* the `jal` step, supplied as ONE hypothesis `JalStep` — the bridge's existing
  per-callee `site_*_ed` jal lemma repackaged: each callee's jal word/offset/link
  differs, so it stays per-bridge, but its shape is uniform (a ~15-line
  `stepObs_jal` + `obs_jal_*` readbacks over the *parked* config);
* the register frame across the body, collapsed to the ABI callee-saved shape via
  `FrameMeta.abiFrame_of_wrChain` (ONE `decide`: `WrChainAvoidAbi bs`) — no
  per-site `get?_sigmaPost_*` threading;
* the footprint frame across the body, via `FrameMeta.memFrame_of_chain`.

## What's generic vs per-bridge

GENERIC (this file, `bridgeOfSeg`, ONE application per bridge):
  the seg run, the ABI frame collapse, the footprint frame, the `Steps` splice,
  the marshalled-register survival across the jal, and the minstret witness.

PER-BRIDGE (supplied to `bridgeOfSeg`):
  (i)   the seg def (`#derive_case`, 3 lines) + the entry pin list `L`;
  (ii)  `hwf : ChainOK` (the row's one `decide`) and `hAvoid : WrChainAvoidAbi bs`
        (one more `decide`);
  (iii) the `JalStep` datum — the ONE genuinely callee-specific seam (different
        jal word/offset/link per callee), a thin repackaging of the existing
        `site_*_ed` jal lemma over the parked config;
  (iv)  a thin `*_closed` wrapper turning the generic `BridgeLanded` post into the
        callee's own entry predicate (`ReallocPre`/`strlen_pre`/…) + carried
        frame, tying the computed marshalled args to the caller's `ofNat` ghosts —
        the `bridgeCapCompute_closed` body's last third, unchanged.

So a NEW bridge = seg def (3) + `JalStep` from the existing jal site lemma (~15) +
`bridgeOfSeg` application (~5) + `*_closed` wrapper (~40, all callee-pre
marshalling).  The ~175-line hand `*Prefix_run` collapses to the `JalStep` +
`bridgeOfSeg` application.

NO `sorry`/`axiom`/`native_decide`/`bv_decide`; no Mathlib.

/-- **The per-callee `jal` seam, as a uniform datum.**  Given the config `σp`
parked at the *computed* jal PC (`= evalBlocksPC pc0 (init L lds) bs`, the seg
body's end) with the seg post established (`GoodState`, that PC, a `minstret`
witness), the bridge's own `jal` site lemma steps once to the callee entry:
* lands at `calleeEntry` (`PC`), links `x1 := link`;
* touches no memory (`σ2.mem = σp.mem`);
* preserves every register except `x1` (`nonRa`), so the marshalled args survive.

This is the ONLY genuinely callee-specific piece (the jal word/offset/link differ
per callee); a bridge proves it in ~15 lines from its existing `site_*_ed` jal
lemma over the parked config, exactly the last two steps of a hand `*Prefix_run`. -/

/-- **`bridgeOfSeg` — the factored Shape-A bridge combinator (∃-form).**

A drop-in replacement for a hand `*Prefix_run` (e.g. `capComputePrefix_run`).
From the entry state `σ` parked at the bridge entry `pc0` (`GHolds σ L`, the entry
memory `= m0`), it runs the `#derive_case` seg body `bs` (up to the jal) via
`segEval_sound`, then takes the `jal` step supplied by `hjal : JalStep …`, and
returns the whole landed run: parked at `calleeEntry`, `x1 = link`, the computed
marshalled registers `GHolds σ' out.regs` surviving the jal, memory
`writeLog m0 out.log`, a `minstret` witness, and the ABI callee-saved frame back
to the entry `σ` — everything the callee's `*_closed` wrapper needs.

* `hwf` — the seg's ONE kernel `decide` (`ChainOK pc0 (keysG L) bs`).
* `hAvoid` — the ABI-frame datum, ONE `decide` (`WrChainAvoidAbi bs`: no register
  the body writes is callee-saved).
* `hKeysOut`/`hRaOut` — two `decide`s on the concrete seg outcome keys (in `1..31`,
  none is `x1`), so the marshalled args survive the jal.
* `hjal` — the per-callee `JalStep` (the bridge's existing `site_*_ed` jal lemma).

The ~30-line per-register `get?_sigmaPost_*` frame chain each hand `*Prefix_run`
wrote is entirely replaced by `abiFrame_of_wrChain hAvoid` (one `decide`) for the
whole body; the jal's own (small) frame comes packaged in `JalStep`.  The concrete
`writeLog m0 out.log` memory is exposed directly — the per-store disjointness a
`*_closed` wrapper needs (e.g. the cap word) is read off it with
`getElem_writeMap4_disjoint`, exactly as the hand version does. -/
