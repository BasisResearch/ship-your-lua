# `BlockMem` — proof-by-reflection block lemma for straight-line ALU + LOAD + STORE runs

Generalizes `BlockPilot`'s `block_alu_sound` (ADDI/ADD only) to the memory
classes: value loads (`lw`/`ld`/`lbu`) and stores (`sw`/`sd`/`sb`).  One lemma,
`block_mem_sound`, consumes a concrete `List MInstr` and produces the whole
`Steps` chain with a *computed* register outcome (`runGM`) **and** a computed
memory outcome: the final memory is the `writeMap` fold (`writeLog`) of a
computed write log (`wlogM : List (addr × width × value)`, symbolic addresses
as base-pin + concrete offset, symbolic data).

## Measured verdict (acceptance test: the mixed 7-instruction `__ssputs_r`
prologue `0x8001438c–0x800143a4` — `addi/sd/lw/sd/sd/mv/mv`, real byte pins +
DecodeTable lemmas, ONE `block_mem_sound` application (`BlockMemDemo.lean`) vs
the same 7 steps via `site_1438c_sp …` per-site ceremony in the
`SnprintfSpec19.tr_ssputs_head` style (`/tmp/bm_ceremony.lean`); *identical*
hypotheses and conclusions: `Steps (u+7)`, tick, `GoodState`, the three nested
`writeMap8` images, HTIF output, `PC = 0x800143a8`, the four written registers
incl. the `lw` value, minstret, and an `x10` frame)

* `lean --profile` proof work (elaboration + tactic execution + kernel):
  reflection **≈ 250 ms** (49 + 181 + 20) vs ceremony **≈ 990 ms**
  (52 + 852 + 86) — **≈ 4× less** at 7 instructions.  The pilot measured 1.7×
  at 3 ALU instructions; the gap grows with block length and pin count as
  predicted — ceremony is O(instrs × tracked-registers) plus per-store
  mem-image/`…Loaded` bookkeeping, reflection O(instrs).
* wall-clock `lean` on the use site (5 runs): reflection **1.22–1.35 s** vs
  ceremony **2.32–2.59 s** — both import-dominated (0.65 s vs 2.0–2.4 s of
  olean loading; the ceremony additionally pulls the `SnprintfSpec19` closure
  for the `…Loaded`-under-store lemmas that reflection does not need).
* line count (identical theorem statement, ≈ 105 shared hypothesis/conclusion
  lines): reflection proof body **30** lines + **9** block-data lines
  (`ssputsProlog`) vs ceremony proof body **192** lines (≈ 27 per instruction
  at 6–7 tracked registers: `obs_*` transports + per-store `mem_afterNextPC`
  image chains + `…Loaded` re-establishment).  Marginal cost per added
  instruction: reflection = 1 data line + 1–3 `ProgFactsM` entries, and 0 new
  lines per extra *tracked register*; ceremony ≈ 1 line per (instruction ×
  register) + ≈ 6 lines per store.
* one-time cost: this file (≈ 1060 lines, of which ≈ 40 are the scripted
  `obs_gpr_store` battery) compiles in ≈ 1.8 s.

**Verdict: WIN, and it grows with the memory classes.**  The pilot's "modest
win now, structural win at scale" sharpens at 7 mixed instructions to a 4×
proof-work and 6.4× proof-body reduction; stores are where the ceremony hurts
most (mem-image chains, `…Loaded` transport, per-register store transports) and
exactly where the block lemma's computed write log + internal code-pin
survival pay off.

## Design deltas over `BlockPilot`

* `MInstr`/`MKind` — the pilot's `AInstr` grown by six memory kinds.  Structure
  stays fully concrete (kinds enumerate the width/sign variants), so the VC
  `BlockOKM` stays decidable; *nothing symbolic ever enters the instruction
  list* (the `decide`-rejects-fvars gotcha).
* **Load data is supplied positionally**: `lds : List (List (BitVec 8))`, one
  byte-list per load in program order.  The loaded value enters the computed
  register outcome as `sign_extend`/`zero_extend` of the LE byte append
  (`bytesVal`), phrased over `bs.getD j 0#8` so no length side condition is
  needed anywhere: for a literal byte list the `getD`s reduce to the bare
  symbolic bytes.
* **Per-element `ProgFactsM` gains the data-dependent side conditions**
  (`MemFacts`): RAM bounds / HTIF-window / alignment at the *symbolic*
  effective address `eaddrM = srcVal rs1 + sext imm`, plus (for loads) the
  byte-definedness pins — stated on the **threaded memory** at that point in
  the block, so loads can read back earlier stores of the same block.  These
  are `Prop`-side hypotheses (they mention symbolic values), *not* `BlockOKM`.
* **The memory thread**: `ProgFactsM` recurses with `stepMemM`, the same
  `applyW` update that `wlogM`/`writeLog` use in the conclusion, so the load
  pins and the final-memory statement share one definition of the evolving map.
* **Code pins survive stores for free**: `BytePinsM` stay on the *entry*
  memory; the induction carries `∀ j < tohostAddr, m[j]? = m0[j]?`, re-proved
  after each store from its `tohostAddr + 16 ≤ addr` window fact (code lives
  below `tohostAddr`, stores land above the window — `*_low_miss`).
* Per-class step consumption: loads go through `stepObs_alu` (a load is a
  register write; memory unchanged) with `exec_lw`/`exec_ld`/`exec_lbu_bm`
  characterizations; stores through `stepObs_store` + `exec_sw`/`exec_sd_val`/
  `exec_sb_bm`.  `exec_lbu_bm`/`exec_sb_bm` are the generic width-1 characterizations
  (the `MemcpySites` per-site `exec_c48`/`exec_c54` shapes, made generic).
* One new 33-branch dispatch battery (`obs_gpr_store`): every GPR pin survives
  a store step.  Everything else (`gprReg`/`gprGet`/`gprRT`/`rX_src`/`wX_gpr`/
  `obs_gpr_rd`/`obs_gpr_other`/`gholds_eraseG`/`srcVal`/`SrcOK`…) is reused
  from `BlockPilot` unchanged.

**Obstructions hit** (the pilot's four all reappear unchanged; new ones):
(5) load data cannot live in `MInstr` — `decide` rejects fvars, so a symbolic
byte in the list would kill the `show BlockOKM … by decide` close; solved by
the positional `lds` + `getD` phrasing.  (6) at the use site the caller
supplies `ProgFactsM` components whose *expected* types are `srcVal`/`eaddrM`
applications over the computed pin list — the anonymous-constructor bundle
elaborates because `lookupG`/`stepGM`/`stepMemM` all whnf-reduce on concrete
keys (symbolic values are never inspected); hypotheses must be phrased with
the *computed* base value (e.g. `v2 + sext 0xfc0 + sext 0x028` for a store
whose base register was written earlier in the block).  (7) the load-pin
obligations land on `writeMap`-image memories when a store precedes the load —
this matches what the per-site ceremony demands at the same point, so nothing
is lost, but callers reading loads *disjoint* from the block's stores must
discharge the image pins from entry pins via `insert`-miss rewrites
(`getElem?_insert_outside`-style), exactly as ceremony compositions do today.

## What branch-terminator support (the remaining class) would need

A taken branch/jump ends the block, so `block_*_sound` becomes a *basic-block*
lemma: `List MInstr` (straight-line body, this file) + an optional terminator
consumed by `stepObs_branch_taken`/`stepObs_branch_nottaken`/`stepObs_j`/
`stepObs_jr` at the end.  Concretely: (1) a `Term` sum type (branch kind + the
two source indices + the 13/21-bit immediate, or jump target); (2) the branch
*condition* (e.g. `zopz0zKzJ_u v13 v9 = false`) is data-dependent, so it joins
`ProgFactsM` as one more per-terminator hypothesis, exactly like the store
window facts; (3) `endPCM` returns the branch target instead of fall-through
in the taken case; (4) the register/memory outcome is unchanged (branches
write nothing) — so no new batteries are needed, only a last non-inductive
step case after the list induction.  The list-induction skeleton is untouched.

**WAVE 48k — TOTAL READS, not presence.**  The Sail model reads memory totally
(`readByte a = (m.get? a).getD 0`), so a load NEVER needs a byte to be in the
map; it needs the byte the total read returns.  These pins therefore say
"the total read at `ea + k` is `bs[k]`", which is exactly what
`bytesVal`/`runGM` consume and is STRICTLY WEAKER than the old
`m[ea+k]? = some bs[k]`: a supplier that knows the byte (an earlier store,
`ValueRepr`, a code pin) still discharges it in one rewrite
(`lpins4_of_present`), while a supplier reading the callee's own unwritten
frame discharges it by `rfl` at `bs[k] = 0`.  Keeping `bs`/`lds` as the value
name is deliberate: the reflected execution stays tied to memory through these
equations, which is what the presence hypotheses used to (over-)provide. -/

/-- **The block lemma.** A concrete list of straight-line ALU/load/store
instructions, with per-element byte pins + decode facts + data-dependent
address side conditions and load-data pins (`ProgFactsM`) and a decidable
structural VC (`BlockOKM`, one `by decide`), turns an entry state with pinned
PC / minstret / source registers into the full `Steps` chain with: tick
invariant, `GoodState`, HTIF output unchanged, the fall-through PC, the
*computed* register outcome `runGM is L lds`, the *computed* memory outcome
`writeLog σ.mem (wlogM is L lds)`, and the register frame outside
`noiseRegs ∪ wrRegsM is`. -/
